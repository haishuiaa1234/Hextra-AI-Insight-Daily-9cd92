# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're agreeing to them, so let's get into it!

## 1. Service Overview
The Site offers users premium paid subscription content and member services. These cool perks include, but aren't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- Users are responsible for the security of their account and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account with anyone else! 🚫
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms. Play by the rules, folks!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe or PayPal). Don't sweat it, we don't store your payment info!
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before the end of your current billing cycle. Set a reminder if you need to! 😉
- **14-day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're unhappy. Each user gets one shot at this refund, so use it wisely! After 14 days or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no unauthorized copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes, okay?
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, for personal growth! 🌱
- If you need it for commercial use or extensive quoting, please reach out to the Site to get proper authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Users are strictly **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes upon others' rights. Let's keep it clean and respectful, people! 💖
- It's a big **no-no** to bulk download, scrape, or crack member content using technical means. Seriously, don't even try it!
- The Site reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. We're not afraid to drop the hammer! 🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate parts or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up!
- The Site **will not be liable for any compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just go sideways, you know? 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical, for example). Always consult a pro, okay?
- The Site is **absolutely not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using our content or services. Use at your own risk!

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- Any disputes arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's try to be friends first, though! 🙏
