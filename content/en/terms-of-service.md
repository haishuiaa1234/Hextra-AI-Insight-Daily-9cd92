# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday**! 👋 Before you dive in and start using our awesome services (we'll just call ourselves "the Site" or "we" from now on), please take a moment to carefully read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our Site, you're basically saying "Yep, I agree!" to everything laid out here.

## 1. What We're All About (Our Services)
**The Site** offers users premium paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. Think blog posts, members-only resources, e-books, and lively community interactions – and that's just scratching the surface! Just a heads-up, some content is only available for our subscribed members.

## 2. Your Account & Registration
- **To register for an account**, you'll need to give us a valid email address and set up a password. Simple enough! 😉
- **You** are totally responsible for keeping your account secure and for all the activity happening under it. So, absolutely **NO** transferring or sharing your account with anyone else.
- **The Site** reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account if you breach these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the juicy details about the fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- **All payments** go through secure third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Relax, we don't store your payment info ourselves. Phew! 🛡️
- **Your subscription** will automatically renew, so if you want to bail, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet: if you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up, each user gets one shot at this refund! Past the 14-day mark or for non-first-time subs, sorry folks, **no refunds** will be issued unless the law absolutely forces our hand.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is copyrighted and **owned by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our express permission. That's a big no-no! 🚫
- **Users** only get a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access the content for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, alright?
- **If you need to use our content** for commercial stuff or want to quote us extensively, just reach out to us for authorization. We're usually pretty cool about it!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Users are strictly prohibited from** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Let's keep things respectful, people! 🙏
- **It's also a big no-go to** bulk download, scrape, or crack member content using technical wizardry. Play fair!
- **The Site** has every right to yank down inappropriate content and **ban offending users**. Don't test us!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or totally terminate some or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how the digital cookie crumbles sometimes! 🍪
- **The Site** won't be on the hook for any compensation if content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control, like force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions. Stuff happens!

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information we provide** on the Site is purely for reference and **should not be taken as** any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Seriously, don't sue us! 😅
- **The Site** is absolutely **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might suffer from using our content or services. Use at your own risk, buddy!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA, without messing with any conflict of law principles. Keepin' it Californian! 🌴
- **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms? Let's try to chat it out nicely first. If that doesn't work, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. So, see you in court, maybe! 😉
