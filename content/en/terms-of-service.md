# Terms of Service
*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "**the Site**" or "**we**" from now on). **These Terms of Service** are super important, so please give them a thorough read before you start using our services. Your access or use of the Site means you're totally on board with these terms – it's your official agreement!

## 1. About Our Services
**The Site** offers users paid subscription content and member services. These goodies include, but aren't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only available to our awesome subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **To register for an account**, users will need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
- **Users** are fully responsible for the security of their account and all activities that happen under it. Seriously, no transferring or sharing your account – that's a big no-no!
- **The Site** reserves the right to suspend or terminate any user account if these terms are violated.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis. You'll see the exact fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- **All payments** are handled via trusted third-party payment platforms (think Stripe, PayPal). Don't sweat it, we never store your payment info on our end.
- **Your subscription** will automatically renew. So, if you don't want to keep the good times rolling, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**:
  - **First-time subscribers**, if you're not totally thrilled with our service, you've got 14 days from your purchase date to snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not satisfied.
  - Quick heads-up: Each user gets one shot at this refund. If it's been more than 14 days or you're not a first-time subscriber, all payments are final and **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely forces our hand.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** on the Site, including all the awesome stuff from hubtoday, is copyrighted by us. No copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our express permission – seriously!
- **Users** get a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access this content, purely for personal learning and reading.
- **If you're eyeing it for commercial use or extensive quoting**, you absolutely need to reach out to us for authorization first.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Don't even think about** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Just don't.
- **Nope, you can't** use technical means to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member content. That's a definite no-go!
- **The Site** reserves the right to yank down inappropriate content and, yep, we'll ban any users who break these rules.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or totally cut off any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how it works.
- **If something happens** like an act of God, server failure, or a third-party service interruption that temporarily makes content unavailable, **the Site** won't be on the hook for any compensation.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by the Site** is purely for general reference – it's definitely **not** professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical, for example).
- **For any direct or indirect losses** users might run into from using the Site's content or services, **the Site** is absolutely **not responsible** – plain and simple.

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- **Should any dispute pop up** arising from or related to these terms, both parties agree to first try and sort it out amicably. If that doesn't work, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
